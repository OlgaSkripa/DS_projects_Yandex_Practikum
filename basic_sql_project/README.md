# Basic SQL: Venture Funds & Investments

Project brief (PDF): [basic_sql_project.pdf](basic_sql_project.pdf)

## Overview
This project is an SQL case study based on a relational database about venture funding and company outcomes.  
The database includes companies, venture funds, funding rounds, investments, acquisitions, and people/education tables.

## Objectives
- Explore dataset coverage (statuses, geography, funding totals).
- Analyse funding activity by country/category and over time.
- Segment funds by investment activity and compare behaviour across groups.
- Analyse acquisitions and compare deal values to prior investment.
- Use people/education tables only in aggregated form.

## What’s inside
- **SQL queries** answering themed analytical questions
- **Short interpretations** explaining what each query returns and why it matters
- **No raw data** is redistributed (course database environment)

## Skills demonstrated
- SQL joins (INNER/LEFT), subqueries, CTEs  
- Aggregations: GROUP BY / HAVING, COUNT / SUM / AVG, filtering  
- Date handling with EXTRACT  
- Building comparable metrics (e.g., deal value vs total prior investment)

## Data notice
The dataset was provided within the Yandex Practicum course environment.  
Raw data is not redistributed here; this repository contains SQL queries and methodology only.
