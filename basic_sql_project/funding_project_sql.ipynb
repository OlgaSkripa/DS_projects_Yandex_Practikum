    "## Overview\n",
    "This project contains a set of SQL queries written to analyse a relational database about companies, venture funds, funding rounds, investments, acquisitions, and people/education.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "The goal is to answer a range of analytical questions using SQL (filtering, joins, aggregation, and subqueries) and to practise working with a multi-table schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook format\n",
    "For each question, I provide:\n",
    "- a short goal statement,\n",
    "- the SQL query,\n",
    "- a brief explanation of what the query returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data notice\n",
    "The analysis was completed in the Yandex Practicum database environment.\n",
    "Raw data is not redistributed here; the repository contains SQL queries and methodology only.\n",

    "- **fund** — venture funds (country_code, invested_companies, investment_rounds, milestones, etc.)\n",
    "- **funding_round** — company funding rounds (company_id, funded_at, funding_round_type, raised_amount, is_first_round, is_last_round, etc.)\n",
    "- **investment** — links funds to company funding rounds (funding_round_id, company_id, fund_id)\n",
    "- **acquisition** — acquisitions between companies (acquiring_company_id, acquired_company_id, term_code, price_amount, acquired_at)\n",

    "- **Duplicates** where a unique record is expected (e.g., IDs or key combinations).\n",
    "- **Join integrity** (spot-check that key relationships behave as expected: companies ↔ funding rounds, funds ↔ investments, etc.).\n",
    "- **Filtering rules** used consistently in analysis (e.g., excluding `funding_total = 0` when focusing on funded companies).\n",
