Data Science projects from Yandex Practikum

Project's name | Description
:-------------- |:--------
[Bank Borrower Reliability](project_bank_ev.ipynb) | Data preprocessing and quality checks for a bank borrower dataset used for credit scoring. The work includes handling missing values and invalid entries, standardising and translating categorical features, rule-based grouping of loan purposes, and descriptive analysis with summary tables to answer stakeholder questions. Libraries: pandas, numpy, re |
[Car price prediction](https://github.com/OlgaSkripa/DS_projects_Yandex_Practikum/car_project/project_car) | A used-car marketplace service (“Не бит, не крашен”) is building an app to attract new customers by providing instant estimates of a car’s market value. Using historical listings data (vehicle specifications, trim/configuration, and prices), the task is to train a regression model to predict the price. The business constraints are prediction quality, inference speed, and training time. Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, re, time, scikit-learn, CatBoost, LightGBM.

[Bank customer churn prediction](https://github.com/OlgaSkripa/DS_projects_Yandex_Practikum/customer_churn_project/project_churn_ev) |Customers are the foundation of any business, including banking. Banks therefore aim to reduce churn. Beta Bank has been losing clients each month — not drastically, but steadily. Since retaining existing customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones, the goal of this project is to build a model that predicts whether a customer will leave the bank in the near future. We use historical data on customers’ behaviour and contract termination. The main target metric is **F1-score** (minimum required value: **0.59**). Additionally, we evaluate **ROC AUC** and compare it with F1. Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
[Real estate price analysis](https://github.com/OlgaSkripa/DS_projects_Yandex_Practikum/real_estate_project/project_real_estate) | Exploratory analysis of Yandex. Realty listings (St Petersburg and nearby areas) to identify the key factors that affect property prices and to support automated anomaly/fraud detection. The dataset combines user-entered listing attributes with geo features (e.g., distance to city centre, airport, parks, and water). Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, datetime.
